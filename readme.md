#HTML and CSS Test Project

This project is to give us an idea of your coding proficiency in HTML and CSS. Try to follow the design as closely as you can.

Fork this project to your own GitHub account and let us know when you're done.

##Guidelines

1. Please make sure all boxes are an even height.
2. Make the design responsive (up to you how it should look on smaller viewports).
3. Use a similar font to what is shown - it's up to you (we use Whitney).
4. For icons, it's up to you: export the images, use an icon font, or find similar HTML entities. We just want to see them, we're not concerned about them matching exactly.
5. Use SASS or CSS. Organize the files whatever way you like.
6. Use images from any public domain, or you can use the ones in the sketch file.
7. Use jQuery to make the popup show/hide on each box when the three dots are clicked.
8. Links don't need to work, but they should be links.
